## Projects

- **[SwiftUI VIPER (Swift 6)](https://github.com/victorgilalejandria/swiftui-viper-swift6)**
  - A SwiftUI-first, Swift 6–compliant *specification* of VIPER: strict module contracts, canonical folder structure, and foundations for enforcement tooling (templates/automation).



More projects and case studies coming soon.
