## Coming soon

I’m currently curating and publishing my work. This page will be updated with:

- public GitHub repositories
- case studies (architecture, tradeoffs, results)
- screenshots / App Store links (where applicable)

### Placeholder entries

- **iOS App / SDK — Coming soon**
  - What I did: architecture, performance, reliability, DX.
  - Tech: Swift, UIKit/SwiftUI, Combine, async/await, CI.

- **Mobile Platform / Architecture — Coming soon**
  - What I did: modularization, build times, testing strategy.
  - Tech: SwiftPM/CocoaPods, fastlane, GitHub Actions.

If you want, send me 3–5 projects (even private) and I’ll turn them into public-friendly case studies.
